## Shot Entry
The Shot Entry page is where you can enter shots for different players to then be viewed in the scouting report. To add a shot, follow these steps:

1. Select a date using the date selector in the top right (Note: This may be below the court depending on the size of your computer monitor). You may select any date, but this field was intended to be the date of the game for which the shot comes from. By selecting a date, you will filter all the shots to only display shots that occur on that specific date.
2. Select a player under "Shot Info".
3. Select shot options. This includes whether the shot was a Serve or a regular Shot, and if the shot was a Kill/Ace, Returned, or Out.
4. Next, select the starting and end spots for the shot on the court.
5. Press "ADD SHOT".

After pressing "ADD SHOT", the shot should display on the court. You can delete the shot by selecting the shot on the court and then pressing delete.

At any time you may press "Reset" which resets all selected options and currently selected spots on the court.

Hovering over "ADD SHOT" and "Delete" will give small reminders on how to add and delete a shot.

You may navigate to the Scouting Report and Rotation Entry pages via the navagation on the left of the screen or the buttons on the bottom right.

## Rotation Entry
The Rotation Entry page is where you can add rotations for a team. 
> The areas mentioned for selecting different parts of a rotation and adding/editing them may appear below the drawing box or to the right. In this documentation, the area will be referred to as being on the right on the screen.

Initially, if there are no rotations added, to the right you will see text that says "No Rotations Added" and a button that says "Add Rotation". By pressing "Add Rotation" you will be able to add any player that has been added to the rotation by selecting the player and then selecting the spot in the rotation where you wish to add the player. Note, each player in the rotation has to be unique (i.e no duplicate players in the rotation). If there are less than 6 players available, the page will ask you to add players to the team.

After adding 6 players to a rotation, you will be brought to the Rotation Entry page. Here, you may add more rotations at the top of the section on the right. Additionally, you may edit the selected rotation by pressing the "Edit Rotation" button.

If multiple rotations are added, you can switch between them by selecting the button displaying the each added rotation number at the top of the section on the right.

To add a route for a rotation, follow these steps.
1. Select a player from the 6 players that are a part of the rotation.
2. Draw the route for the player in the box on the left of the screen by holding down right click to draw in the box.
3. Press the "Add Route" button.

To delete a route for a rotation, follow these steps:
1. Select a player with a route already drawn in the drawing box.
2. Press the "Delete Route" button.

When adding notes in the sections below the drawing box or below the players in the current rotation on the right hand of the screen, make sure to press the corresponding save button.

You may navigate to the Scouting Report and Shot Entry pages via the navagation on the left of the screen or the buttons on the bottom right.
