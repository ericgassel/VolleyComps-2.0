## Shot Entry
The Shot Entry page is where you can enter shots for different players to then be viewed in the scouting report. To add a shot, follow these steps:

1. Select a date using the date selector in the top right (Note: This may be below the court depending on the size of your computer monitor). You may select any date, but this field was intended to be the date of the game for which the shot comes from. By selecting a date, you will filter all the shots to only display shots that occur on that specific date.
2. Select a player under "Shot Info".
3. Select shot options. This includes whether the shot was a Serve or a regular Shot, and if the shot was a Kill/Ace, Returned, or Out.
4. Next, select the starting and end spots for the shot on the court.
5. Press "ADD SHOT".

After pressing "ADD SHOT", the shot should display on the court. You can delete the shot by selecting the shot on the court and then pressing delete.

At any time you may press "Reset" which resets all selected options and currently selected spots on the court.

Hovering over "ADD SHOT" and "Delete" will give small reminders on how to add and delete a shot.
